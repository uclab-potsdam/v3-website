      <h1>Amazonia Future Lab</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      <p class="start">This is a pilot project based on objects from multiple collections, aiming to overcome disciplinary, institutional and spatial boundaries and to create digital and analog spaces of networking, mutual understanding and mediation. The things stored in the deposit cabinets of museums and the stacks of libraries and archives are more than silent witnesses of appropriation, circulation and reinterpretation. In each of them, relationships between people, plants, ancestors, and other beings as well as territories materialize. Even in their momentary status as objects of collecting institutions, they have the potential to connect different life-worlds, forms of knowledge and knowledge practices, and thereby to return to life itself – a life that transcends the walls of collecting institutions. This endeavor requires the development of novel formats and tools.

      <p class="navSection">Within the framework of the project, we are developing digital tools in close collaboration between Brazilian and German partners. From different perspectives, they bundle and connect information on collection objects. A central challenge is to convey the diverse approaches in their complexity. In this way, historically grown separations between collection institutions are to be overcome. We take into account disciplinary and institutional logics of organization and classification as well as indigenous knowledge orders and practices. Historical ethnographic and botanical collections from the Brazilian Amazon region and cultural-historical collections for their contextualization—including field diaries, photographs, maps, sound recordings, films, secondary literature—serve as case studies. Over the last 200 years, these artifacts, plants, and documents have been collected, stored, classified, conserved, restored, and researched in the Ethnological Museum, the Botanical Museum and Botanical Garden, and the Ibero-American Institute. Only a part of these extensive collections has been explored in greater depth and is available digitally. So far, the collections have not yet been connected across institutions and countries.

      <p>The general aim of the project is to use the potential of digital formats and tools to communicate, exchange, network and jointly create new knowledge from different perspectives, knowledge practices and social contexts. The connected knowledge will be publicly accessible in its processuality, via interactive formats of exploration and participation. The tools created will subsequently be made freely available and can thus be used or further developed by other communities and institutions that are engaged in the field of participatory cultural education. The ambition is to devise visualization prototypes for three complementary approaches to cultural knowledge: workbench, wanderer mode, and wonderwall. Each of these modes represents a central goal of the project: connection, comprehension, and communication.</p>

        The project is rooted in the experiences from past cooperations and solid institutional partnerships. In the context of <a href="http://www.humboldt-lab.de/en/projektarchiv/index.html" target="_blank">Humboldt Lab Dahlem</a> (2012-2015), the project <a href="http://www.humboldt-lab.de/en/project-archive/probebuehne-7/sharing-knowledge/project-description/index.html" target="_blank">“Sharing Knowledge”</a> (2016-2020) was initiated, funded by the Volkswagen Foundation. While contributing to a decolonial approach to ethnological collections, the previous projects faced practical limitations, which concerned particularly the development and usability of a digital platform for collaborative research purposes together with source communities. Besides the structural and technical constraints to implement the tool in a sustainable way (among others, limited local infrastructure and unstable internet availability), one central question has emerged: how to properly adapt digital tools to the realities and needs of the communities. This refers especially to the platform's restricted adequacy to process and display information in a way that embraces multiple perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>“Amazonia Future Lab” aims at addressing these weak spots and working on solutions that can both accommodate the views of indigenous cultures, and do justice to the complex connections entailed in their knowledge systems.
      </p>
      <p>The lessons learned, along with a broad network of institutional and local partners, represent a unique opportunity to build up the collaborative processes that are fundamental to this research—for instance, through the long cooperation history of the Museu Nacional with indigenous researchers in Brazil. By moving away from strictly disciplinary, museum-centered views of biocultural artifacts, we create better conditions to develop tools that can promote a holistic approach to museum collections. Our goal is hence to extend and intensify the work initiated with “Sharing Knowledge”, as well as to tackle central challenges of multiperspectivity and decolonization of knowledge production.

      <p >The Ethnologisches Museum (Ethnological Museum) evolved from the collections of the royal cabinets of art and since its foundation in 1873 has become one of the largest and most significant collections of its kind worldwide. The museum's holdings comprise approximately 500,000 ethnographic, archaeological and historical-cultural objects from Africa, Asia, America and Oceania. They are complemented by some 500,000 media (ethnological photographs, films, audio recordings) and about 200,000 pages of written documents. Many of its collections are among the most extensive and valuable in existence.</p>
