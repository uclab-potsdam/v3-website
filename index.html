        <p class="start">The indigenous communities of the Upper Xingu south of the Amazon river recognise objects, places, plants, myths, rites, and spiritual owners as intertwined entities that form entangled lifeworlds. However western museal practices centre on artefacts and divide them along disciplinary boundaries into separate institutions such as ethnological museums, botanical collections, and libraries. The Amazonia Future Lab develops new formats and tools to recontextualise Xingu artefacts into narratives that surface their complex interrelationships while adequately representing indigenous perspectives.

      <img id="grid-image" src="assets/img/wanderer.png" alt="wanderer" width="450">
      <p>In the framework's production mode, data can be visualised in a network of relations by adding, connecting and arranging entities on a canvas. In a second step, these flowcharts can be animated in coordination with videos, by zooming and panning and by highlighting or blurring to focus on selected elements. A flexible exhibition setup combining linear video and interactive visualisation allows to exhibit the data and invite visitors to explore the possibilities of user-guided navigation along data relations and video clips.
        With its emphasis on illustrating entangled structures, the framework is suitable for future use cases in the fields of cultural
        collections, science communication and beyond. The Wanderer is freely available as <a href="https://github.com/uclab-potsdam/wanderer" target="_blank">open source software on GitHub</a>.

    <p> Xingu Entangled underscores the rich interconnectedness of objects, places, events, organisms, and spiritual actors and weaves them into non-linear narratives and data structures. By emphasising boundary objects over physical artefacts, it bridges disciplinary domains and effectively communicates manifold perspectives. The interactive capacity of the two-channel installation allows visitors to freely explore the graphs and videos, while also offering situated storytelling with voices and perspectives from the Xingu community.

    <div class="block">
      <p class="navSection">Departing from historical-ethnographic and botanical collections from and about the Brazilian Amazon region, the Amazonia Future Lab shifts the focus from the discrete artefact to the relational context of its manufacturing process, its usage or its significance within traditional rituals. The aim of the project is to develop a framework that allows the contextualisation of data in a graph with meaningful relations and to render these relations navigable and narratable. As an intercultural and interdisciplinary team of designers, ethnologists, curators, botanists, and indigenous researchers, we further aim to support and adequately represent multiple knowledge systems.

      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <p class="navSection">
          The project is rooted in the experiences from past cooperations and solid institutional partnerships. In the context of <a href="http://www.humboldt-lab.de/en/projektarchiv/index.html" target="_blank">Humboldt Lab Dahlem</a> (2012-2015), the project <a href="http://www.humboldt-lab.de/en/project-archive/probebuehne-7/sharing-knowledge/project-description/index.html" target="_blank">“Sharing Knowledge”</a> (2016-2020) was initiated, funded by the Volkswagen Foundation. While contributing to a decolonial approach to ethnological collections, the previous projects faced practical limitations, which concerned particularly the development and usability of a digital platform for collaborative research purposes together with source communities. Besides the structural and technical constraints to implement the tool in a sustainable way (among others, limited local infrastructure and unstable internet availability), one central question has emerged: how to properly adapt digital tools to the realities and needs of the communities. This refers especially to the platform's restricted adequacy to process and display information in a way that embraces multiple perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>“Amazonia Future Lab” aims at addressing these weak spots and working on solutions that can both accommodate the views of indigenous cultures, and do justice to the complex connections entailed in their knowledge systems.
        </p>
        <p>The lessons learned, along with a broad network of institutional and local partners, represent a unique opportunity to build up the collaborative processes that are fundamental to this research—for instance, through the long cooperation history of the Museu Nacional with indigenous researchers in Brazil. By moving away from strictly disciplinary, museum-centered views of biocultural artifacts, we create better conditions to develop tools that can promote a holistic approach to museum collections. Our goal is hence to extend and intensify the work initiated with “Sharing Knowledge”, as well as to tackle central challenges of multiperspectivity and decolonization of knowledge production.

        With our installation, we illustrated the potential of collaboration between science, design practice and indigenous knowledge.

        <p>Results from the research project Amazonia Future Lab are being shown internationally as part of the exhibition Existência Numérica in Rio de Janeiro. Indigenous perspectives on the interdependencies between humans and the environment are made visible in the form of the video installation Xingu Entangled, which combines documentary film footage with interactive visualisations.
          In its second edition, “Existência Numérica” is being hosted by the cultural center “Futuros - Arte e Tecnologia”, in Rio de Janeiro.
          Curated by Barbara Castro, Doris Kosminsky and Luiz Ludwig, the exhibition dwells upon the complexity of data visualization and its applications in the world of visual arts.

        <p>During the project workshop in Macucu, so-called indigenous environmental agents, who work together
          with the Brazilian non-governmental organisation ISA (Instituto Socioambiental), were guests in Colombia.
          The focus was on an exchange about the astronomical cycle of the year and observations of the
          constellations, natural phenomena, rituals, and associated myths. The circular calendar representations
          common in the region and especially in the Brazilian context were adapted for the community in Colombia.
          During the workshop week, the participants experimented with various artistic techniques of representation and
          attempts at abstraction.

          A particular emphasis was placed on the Buriti palm, the various artefacts made from its components and
          the myths associated with it. While the women of the community continued to work with different
          types of tuahi under the supervision of three ologi, several men made the gimi head rings.
          As the end of the workshop coincided with the start of the kuarup ritual to commemorate the deceased,
          the new gimi were used straight away.

        <h4>Workshop on transgenerational transfer of knowledge</h4>
        <p>The first project workshop in Ipatse focussed on the transgenerational transfer of practical knowledge and material skills. The community appointed so-called ologi, older people
          with special skills, to show others how to make certain artefacts. The activities were organised according to
          gender: While the women concentrated on tuahi, mats made from fibres of the Buriti palm, the
          men worked on fish traps made from the Ambé liana. The activities were affected by severe forest
          fires in the region.

        <p>This workshop investigated postcolonial approaches to collections, databases, practices,

           navigating, experiencing, and contesting rich information spaces.
